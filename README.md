Experimental soil-water-balance code in Python.

Conversion of FORTRAN to python for most of the SWB2 model (Westenbroek and others, 2010; Westenbroek and others, 2018). 
Includes rough implementations of some of the algorithms used in the
USGS Soil-Water-Balance Code (Westenbroek and others, 2010; Westenbroek and others, 2018). 

This code is untested, unsupported, and currently does not work. It needs a lot of work and testing.
